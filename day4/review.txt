I am writing this as someone who has relatively strong foundation in Java from my undergrad studies.
I studied ComputerEng in uni, and I did most of my projects in Java back then.

Here goes my review of the subject.

let parcipants = students

Positive aspects:
- Demonstrated strong command in the subject
- Good explanations and insights
- I like it when the instructor references the industry practice during explanation
- I like the ice breaker where a question is asked before the formal start of lecture
- Always helps when a participant is asking for it

Areas for improvement:
- DOCUMENTATION. It could be enhanced to provided clearer instructions and other resources to follow.
By investing in better documentation, you only need to invest time for one curriculum, and you can reuse
it for the future, and will only need to update what is needed.
It should follow, at the very least, the flow of:
* Link to the slide used in class
* Here's the activity (all requirements explained)
* Instructions on the repository to be created
* How to submit
* References as guide
- Activity instructions would benefit by giving step-by-step (for beginners)
- Consider having optional advanced-level challenges in activities
- Remember that most of the participants are beginners, they might have a hard time absorbing knowledge
- Just do the quizzes in Google Forms
- Stop asking the participant to raise hand if they are done. Raise hand is meant to be used if someone wants
to ask questions. Just ask if someone is having an issue, and assume the ones who did not raise their hand is good
on their end.
- Notes/scratch should NOT be graded. I don't want to force myself to take notes if I already know about what is being taught.
- An alternative to notes should be an optional activity for advanced students. So they can demonstrate their skills.
- When you are doing a demo-code, always push it to your repo, and share it with the class. So everyone can follow. It should be
the participant's fault if they do not know how to git.
