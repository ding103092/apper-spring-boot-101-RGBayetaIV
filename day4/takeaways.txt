In learning Springboot, I realized that having strong background in Java really helps.
Just by knowing the syntax and concept of Java helped me easily grasp the core principles of Springboot.

Working with Springboot, Docker, and MySQL has been relatively easy as well. I found the integration of
Springboot with CRUD operations with SQL databases really great, since it's very intuitive. All we need to remember
is to ensure that the configurations of Springboot and Docker Container is compatible (e.g. ports) so that we can
establish a successful conneciton. It also helps to read documentation whenever there's a blocker.

Honestly, what I really really need is experience to familiarize myself more on production-level code, and see
how these things come together. When you are learning it, we are essentially doing everything from scratch, which 
is far from what we are expected to do during actual work.

I am looking forward on what lies ahead in my journey as a Software Engineer. :)
