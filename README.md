# apper-spring-boot-101-RGBayetaIV

### Day 1  
This is an intro to Spring-Boot  
### Day 2
With actual codes, I added notes where I attempted to use Springboot with mysql

Also fully complied with https://github.com/orvyl/account-service/blob/master/lab_1.txt for the Lab 1 submission.  
See demo: https://youtu.be/7K3KBtSxlTE (Shows all possible actions, I think)

Using the IntelliJ Ultimate, I used the HTTP Request instead of Postman API Platform. I think next session will include mysql with mini-nocash app (debit, credit) logic applied. Will read more on Springboot and MySQL before that session. :)

### Day 4
Tested all, refer to https://github.com/ding103092/apper-spring-boot-101-RGBayetaIV/blob/main/day4/the-blog/src/tbshttprequest.http for all testing done.
Do note that all prompts related to ID must be manually edited, as it's randomly generated
