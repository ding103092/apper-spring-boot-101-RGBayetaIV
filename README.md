### Day 1  
This is an intro to Spring-Boot  
### Day 2
With actual codes, I added notes where I attempted to use Springboot with mysql
Also fully complied with https://github.com/orvyl/account-service/blob/master/lab_1.txt  
for the Lab 1 submission.  

Using the IntelliJ Ultimate, I used the HTTP Request instead of Postman API Platform.
